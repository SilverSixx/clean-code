package DesignPattern.CreationalPattern.Factory;

// In the context of the Factory Pattern, a Product refers to the objects that are created by the factory.
// These products are typically instances of a specific class or interface
// that the factory is responsible for creating.
// The main idea of the Factory Pattern is to encapsulate the creation logic of these products,
// thereby allowing the client code to create objects without having to know the specifics of their instantiation.

// Example of Factory Pattern in a Java Spring Application
// Let's create an example where we have different types of notifications (products),
// and a factory is responsible for creating these notifications.
