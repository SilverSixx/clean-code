package DesignPattern.StructuralPattern.Facade;

// The Facade Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
// It aims to make a subsystem easier to use by providing a unified interface
// through which clients can interact with the subsystem.

//Key Concepts of the Facade Pattern
//Facade: The facade class provides a simple interface to the complex subsystem.
//Subsystem Classes: These are the classes that perform the work of the subsystem. The facade delegates calls to these classes.

//Example of the Facade Pattern in a Java Spring Application
//Let's consider an example where we have an e-commerce application
// with a complex subsystem that handles ordering, payment, and shipping.
// We will create a facade to simplify the interface for these operations.
