package DesignPattern.StructuralPattern.Decorator;

// The Decorator Pattern is a structural design pattern used to dynamically add behavior to objects without modifying their code.
// This pattern is particularly useful when you want to enhance the functionalities of an object in a flexible and reusable way.

// Example of Decorator Pattern in Java Spring Application
// Letâ€™s consider an example where we have a notification system, and we want to add functionalities
// like logging, encryption, and compression to the basic notification sending functionality.
