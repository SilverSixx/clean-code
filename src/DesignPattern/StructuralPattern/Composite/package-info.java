package DesignPattern.StructuralPattern.Composite;

// The Composite Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows you to compose objects
// into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It lets clients treat
// individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.

//Example of Composite Pattern in a Java Spring Application
//Let's consider a scenario where we have a system for managing tasks.
// A task can be a simple task or a composite task (a task composed of multiple sub-tasks).
// We will use the composite pattern to represent this hierarchy.
