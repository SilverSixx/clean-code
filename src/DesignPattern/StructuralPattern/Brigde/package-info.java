package DesignPattern.StructuralPattern.Brigde;

// The Bridge Pattern is a structural design pattern that decouples an abstraction from
// its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
// This pattern is useful when you want to separate an abstraction from its implementation, allowing them to evolve separately.

//Example of Bridge Pattern in a Java Spring Application
//Let's consider a scenario where we have different types of notifications
// (e.g., email, SMS) and different platforms (e.g., web, mobile).
// We want to be able to send any type of notification on any platform.
