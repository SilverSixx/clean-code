package DesignPattern.StructuralPattern.Adapter;

// The Adapter Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects
// with incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between
// two incompatible interfaces by converting the interface of a class into another interface that a client expects.

//Example of Adapter Pattern in a Java Spring Application
//Let's create an example where we have an existing notification system
// that we want to integrate with a new third-party notification library.
// We'll use the adapter pattern to make the two systems compatible.
