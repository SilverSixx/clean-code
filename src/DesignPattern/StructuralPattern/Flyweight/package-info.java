package DesignPattern.StructuralPattern.Flyweight;

// The Flyweight Pattern is a structural design pattern used to minimize memory usage
// or computational expenses by sharing as much data as possible with similar objects.
// It is particularly useful when dealing with a large number of similar objects.
// The key idea is to store shared data in a single place and use it across multiple objects,
// which helps to reduce memory footprint and improve performance.

// Example of the Flyweight Pattern in a Java Spring Application
// Let's consider an example where we have a text editor that deals with a large number of character objects.
// Each character can be represented as a flyweight object.
