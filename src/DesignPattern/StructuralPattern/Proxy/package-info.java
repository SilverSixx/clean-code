package DesignPattern.StructuralPattern.Proxy;

// The Proxy Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder
// for another object to control access to it. This can be useful in various scenarios
// such as lazy initialization, access control, logging, and more.
// The proxy pattern allows for additional functionality to be provided without changing the original object's code.

// Example of the Proxy Pattern in a Java Spring Application
// Letâ€™s consider an example where we have a DatabaseService that performs database operations.
// We want to add logging functionality without modifying the original DatabaseService.
