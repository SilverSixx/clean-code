package DesignPattern.BehavioralPattern.Memento;

// The Memento Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows capturing and restoring
// the internal state of an object without violating encapsulation.
// It is often used to implement undo mechanisms or to save and restore the state of an object.

// Example of the Memento Pattern in a Java Spring Application
// Letâ€™s consider an example where we have a text editor application that allows users to write and undo changes.
