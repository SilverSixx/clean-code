package DesignPattern.BehavioralPattern.Iterator;

// The Iterator Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that provides a way to access elements
// of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
// It allows clients to traverse through the elements of a collection without knowing the underlying data structure,
// such as arrays or lists.

// Example of the Iterator Pattern in a Java Spring Application
// Letâ€™s consider an example where we have a collection of books, and we want to provide an iterator to iterate over these books.
