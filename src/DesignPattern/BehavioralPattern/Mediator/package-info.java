package DesignPattern.BehavioralPattern.Mediator;

// The Mediator Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that promotes loose coupling
// by controlling communication between objects through a mediator object.
// It centralizes communication logic between multiple objects, allowing them to interact
// without being explicitly aware of each other.

// Example of the Mediator Pattern in a Java Spring Application
// Letâ€™s consider an example where we have a chat room application where users can send messages to each other through a mediator.
