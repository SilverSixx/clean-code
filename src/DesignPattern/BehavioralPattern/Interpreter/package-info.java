package DesignPattern.BehavioralPattern.Interpreter;

// The Interpreter Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that is used to define the grammar of a language
// and to interpret sentences in that language. It provides a way to evaluate sentences in a language
// by defining a syntax tree and providing rules for interpreting the syntax tree.

// Example of the Interpreter Pattern in a Java Spring Application
// Letâ€™s consider an example where we have a simple language for arithmetic expressions
// and we want to build an interpreter to evaluate these expressions.
