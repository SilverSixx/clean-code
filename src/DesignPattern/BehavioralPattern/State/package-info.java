package DesignPattern.BehavioralPattern.State;

// The State Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to
// alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The pattern encapsulates states
// into separate classes and delegates the behavior associated with each state to these classes.
// This allows the object's behavior to vary based on its internal state, without having a complex conditional structure.

// Example of the State Pattern in a Java Spring Application
// Let's consider an example where we have a traffic light that changes its color based on the state of the traffic signal.
