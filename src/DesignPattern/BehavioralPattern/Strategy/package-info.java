package DesignPattern.BehavioralPattern.Strategy;

//The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a family of algorithms,
// encapsulates each one of them, and makes them interchangeable. It allows a client
// to choose from a set of algorithms at runtime without altering the client's code.
// This pattern promotes the Open/Closed Principle, as it allows for adding new algorithms without modifying existing code.

// Example of the Strategy Pattern in a Java Spring Application
// Let's consider an example where we have a payment processing system that needs to support multiple payment methods,
// such as credit card, PayPal, and Google Pay.
