package DesignPattern.BehavioralPattern.Command;

// The Command Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object
// that contains all the information about the request. This transformation allows parameterization
// of clients with different requests, queuing of requests, and logging of the requests.
// It also provides support for undoable operations.

// Example of the Command Pattern in a Java Spring Application
// Letâ€™s consider an example where we have a home automation system with commands to turn on and off lights and fans.
