package DesignPattern.BehavioralPattern.Observer;

// The Observer Pattern is a behavioral design pattern where an object,
// known as the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers,
// and notifies them of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.
// It establishes a one-to-many relationship between objects, allowing multiple observers to listen for changes in a subject's state.

// Example of the Observer Pattern in a Java Spring Application
// Let's consider an example where we have a weather station that broadcasts weather updates to multiple display panels.
