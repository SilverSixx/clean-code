package DesignPattern.BehavioralPattern.Template;

// The Template Method Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a method,
// deferring some steps to subclasses. It allows subclasses to redefine certain steps of the algorithm
// without changing its structure. The Template Method Pattern promotes code reuse and follows the Open/Closed Principle,
// as the overall algorithm structure remains unchanged while allowing customization of certain steps.

// Example of the Template Method Pattern in a Java Spring Application
// Let's consider an example where we have a recipe application that provides a template for cooking different dishes.
